# Writing skill

A skill for Claude that writes and edits prose people read (reports, dissertations, lab books, essays, lay summaries, emails and Teams messages) in a natural voice with UK English, and verifies every citation against scholarly registries. It ships with a checker that flags the measurable signs of machine-written text.

## Layout

- `writing/`: the skill itself. `SKILL.md` routes each request to a register in `writing/registers/` and points to the shared rules (`tells.md`, `clarity.md`, `sources.md`, `exemplars.md`).
- `writing/scripts/check.py`: the draft checker, standard library only.
- `writing/scripts/verify.py`: the source verifier, standard library only.
- `install.py`: installs the skill and builds the upload zip.
- `tests/`: checker rules, verifier, skill structure and installer.

## Install

Requires Python 3.12 or later.

```
python install.py
```

This copies `writing/` to `~/.claude/skills/writing`, where Claude Code picks it up in every project, and writes `dist/writing.zip`. Upload the zip in claude.ai under Settings, Capabilities, Skills to use it in chats. Run the command again after any change so both copies stay identical.

Options: `--skills-dir` and `--dist` change the destinations; `--source` installs from another folder. The installer refuses to replace a `writing` folder that holds a different skill.

## Use

Ask for the writing in plain words ("draft the discussion for my report", "rephrase this for Teams") and the skill loads itself, or call it with `/writing`.

The checker also runs on its own:

```
python writing/scripts/check.py draft.tex
python writing/scripts/check.py notes.md --format markdown
python writing/scripts/check.py - < message.txt
```

The format follows the extension (`.md`, `.tex`, anything else plain) unless `--format` is given. It exits 1 if any error is found, 2 if the draft cannot be read, and 0 otherwise. Errors (dashes used as punctuation, emoji, chatbot phrases) must be fixed. Warnings need judgement: physics uses some flagged words, such as potential or robust, in their technical sense.

The verifier checks cited papers against Crossref, OpenAlex and arXiv:

```
python writing/scripts/verify.py sources.jsonl > references-log.md
python writing/scripts/verify.py - < sources.jsonl
```

Each input line is one source as the draft cites it: a key, a DOI or arXiv ID, the title, the authors' surnames, the year, optionally volume and pages, and the quoted passages each claim rests on. `writing/sources.md` gives the format. For each source it compares the cited fields with the registry record, looks for retractions and newer arXiv versions, and searches the abstract (or a saved full text) for each quote word for word. It prints the verification log as a Markdown table, a row as each source finishes. It exits 0 if every source is verified, 1 if any is not, 2 if the input cannot be read and 3 if the run stops on a fault. It needs network access, checks at most 50 sources per run and stops checking after five minutes. DOIs registered outside Crossref are reported unverified.

## Development

```
uv sync
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy
